# Cricket Social POC

This repository contains a simple proof‑of‑concept front end for a cricket‑oriented social media platform. The application is implemented in plain HTML and JavaScript using the Vue 3 framework loaded from a CDN.  

## Features

* Lists live and upcoming cricket matches.
* Clicking a match opens a discussion view with multiple threads: match‑level, toss, over, wicket and milestones.
* Users can post multiple comments in the match thread and a single comment in all other threads.
* Comments are displayed in a flat (YouTube‑style) feed with timestamps.
* A placeholder is provided for future LLM integration to summarise discussion sentiment.

To view the application, simply open `index.html` in a web browser. No build step is required.
